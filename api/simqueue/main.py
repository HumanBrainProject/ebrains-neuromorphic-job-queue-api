description = """
The EBRAINS neuromorphic computing remote access service allows users to run simulations/emulations
on the [SpiNNaker](https://www.ebrains.eu/tools/spinnaker)
and [BrainScaleS](https://www.ebrains.eu/tools/brainscales) systems
by submitting a [PyNN](http://neuralensemble.org/docs/PyNN/) script
and associated job configuration information to a central queue.

The system consists of:
- a web API (this service) [[Source code](https://github.com/HumanBrainProject/hbp_neuromorphic_platform)]
- a GUI client (the [Job Manager app](https://job-manager.hbpneuromorphic.eu/))
- a [Python/command-line client](https://github.com/HumanBrainProject/hbp-neuromorphic-client).

Users can submit scripts stored locally on their own machine, in a public Git repository,
in the [EBRAINS Knowledge Graph](https://search.kg.ebrains.eu/?category=Model),
or in [EBRAINS Collaboratory](https://wiki.ebrains.eu/) storage (Drive/Bucket).
Users can track the progress of their job, and view and/or download the results,
log files, and provenance information.

To use the API, <a href="/login" target="_blank">login here</a>, click on "Authorize" then
copy the *access_token* into the "HTTPBearer" box
(this process will be streamlined for the final release).

For more information, visit the [EBRAINS website](https://www.ebrains.eu/modelling-simulation-and-computing/simulation/neuromorphic-computing-3).

This service was developed in the Human Brain Project,
funded from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation
under Specific Grant Agreements No. 720270, No. 785907 and No. 945539
(Human Brain Project SGA1, SGA2 and SGA3).
